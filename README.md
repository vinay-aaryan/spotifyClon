Spotify Clone
Description
This project is a functional clone of Spotify built to reinforce and polish core front-end development skills. The main focus is to deepen the understanding of:

JavaScript concepts such as event handling, DOM manipulation, and asynchronous programming using APIs.

Creating a responsive user interface using HTML and CSS.

Building dynamic functionalities like playlist management, seekbar interactions, volume control, and album generation from structured data.

The application demonstrates how client-side logic can be used to build interactive media applications without a back-end.

Features:
Fully functional music player UI

Dynamic song and album creation from metadata (info.json)

Seekbar to control song progress

Volume control functionality

Playlist functionality with ability to load multiple albums

Real-time UI updates based on song metadata

Clean and responsive layout for various devices
